### Simple Asynchronous Read/Write

#### Category: VISA

#### Description:
This example demonstrates how to use the IVI-VISA .NET Library to
perform simple asynchronous operations.  With asynchronous
operations, you first call a method to start the operation. You then
call a second method to complete the operation.  The first method
returns a handle that you can use to check the progress of the operation.

#### Language: C#  

#### Required Software: IVI-VISA  

#### Required Hardware: Any message-based device
