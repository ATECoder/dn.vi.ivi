### Parameter Ranges
See [Specifications](#Specifications) for parameter ranges.

<a name="meter_menu"></a>
### Meter Menu

Selecting _Meter_ from the [Main Menu](#Main_menu) displays the [Meter Menu](#meter_menu). The front panel displays __Meter__ with the following options: 

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [Channel](#channel_menu) | Selects the source channel (only for meters with dual source channels ) |
| [Driver](#driver_menu) | Selects compatibility with the legacy TTM drivers.
| [Leads](#leads_menu) | Sets the leads resistance for contact check.
| [Checks](#Checks_menu) | Sets the contact checks options.

<a name="channel_menu"></a>
#### Channel Menu

The channel menu selects either `smua` or `smub` as the active source meter for instruments with dual source meter units. This setting is enabled (turned on) only for instruments with a two source measure units.

Selecting _Channel_ from the [Meter Menu](#meter_menu) displays the [Channel Menu](#channel_menu) showing the current value, `smua` or `smub` (`smua` in this case):

- Title: __SMU: smua__.
- Options: __smua__ __smub__.

Navigating to `smub` and pressing the _Navigation Wheel_ or `ENTER` selects the `smub` channel.

<a name="driver_menu"></a>
#### Driver Menu

Selecting _Driver_ from the [Meter Menu](#meter_menu) displays the [Driver Menu](#driver_menu):

- Title: __01__
- Description: _Set to 1 for legacy driver_

Moving the cursor over the 1, the number blinks. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` and turning the _Wheel_ changes the value between 0 and 1. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` selects the new value. Pressing `EXIT` cancels the selection.

Set the driver option to `1` if using the meter with the legacy Visual Basic Driver that supported versions 2.3.4009 or earlier of the TTM Meter as used by the ISR TTM Driver version 2.3.4063. Set the value to `0` to use the Meter with software that supports the new features of the firmware.

<a name="leads_menu"></a>
#### Leads Menu

The [Leads Menu](#leads_menu) sets the maximum allowed open leads resistance. The measurement will be aborted after a contact check if leads resistance exceeds above this value.

The contact check function prevents measurements that may be in error due to excessive resistance in the force or sense leads when making remotely sensed (Kelvin) measurements. Potential sources for this resistance include poor contact at the device under test (DUT), failing relay contacts on a switching card or wires that are too long or thin.

The contact check function also detects an open circuit that may occur when a four-point probe is misplaced or misaligned. This relationship is shown schematically in the figure below, where R~C~ is the resistance of the mechanical contact at the DUT, and R~S~ is the series resistance of cables and any series relays.

The leads contacts are checked if the maximum leads resistance (see below) is set to a non-zero positive value. Contacts are measured before taking the initial resistance measurement. The measurement is aborted and the lead resistances are displayed if the measured lead resistances exceeds the maximum limit. 

Check [Open Source Lead Limit Menu](#open_source_lead_limit_menu) for a workaround that is aimed to overcome an issue with the standard contact check.

![](ContactCheckDiagram.png)

To enable and set the maximum allowed leads resistance:

Selecting _Leads_ from the [Meter Menu](#meter_menu) displays the [Leads Menu](#leads_menu) displaying the maximum resistance beyond which the leads are taken as open. The resistance is in Ohms between 10 and 999:

- Title: __100 Î©__
- Description: _Max Leads Resistance_

The range is: 10 - 999.

Moving the cursor over the digits, the digit blinks. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` and turning the _Wheel_ changes the digit between 0 and 9. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` selects the new value.

<a name="contacts_check_menu"></a>
#### Contacts Check Menu

Selecting _Checks_ from the [Meter Menu](#meter_menu) displays the [Checks Menu](#Checks_menu). This menu selects when contact checks are to be performed. This is done by setting a bit value that toggles the contact check for Initial Resistance (IR) (binary 001), Thermal Transient (TR) (binary 010) or Final Resistance (FR) (binary 100). For example, setting the value to 5 (binary 101), enables contact checks before the Initial and Final Resistance measurements whereas setting the value to 7 (binary 111 or 1+2+4), enables contact checks before the initial, final, and thermal transient measurements.

|Bit|Name|Hex Value|Decimal Value|Description|
|----|----|----|----|
|B0|Pre-Initial-Resistance|0x01|1|Check contacts before making the initial cold resistance measurement. This value is always set.|
|B1|Pre-Thermal-Transient|0x02|2|Check contacts before making the thermal transient measurement|
|B2|Pre-Final-Resistance|0x04|4|Check contacts before making the final cold resistance measurement|

- Title: __01__
- Description: _Pre-IR[1]+TR[2]+FR[3]_

The expected range are: 1, 3, 5, 7.

Moving the cursor over the digits, the digit blinks and changes with the rotation of the _Navigation Wheel_ the number blinks. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` and turning the _Wheel_ changes the digit between 0 and 9. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` selects the new value.

<a name="open_source_lead_limit_menu"></a>
#### Open Source Lead Limit Menu

The [Open Source Lead Limit Menu](#open_source_lead_limit_menu) sets the maximum DUT resistance. This value is used by the modified [Contact Check Algorithm](#Contact_Check_Algorithm) to determine if either one of the source terminals is open of if the DUT resistance is so high that the DUT leads are taken to be open.

Selecting _Limit_ from the [Meter Menu](#meter_menu) displays the [Open Source Lead Limit Menu](#open_source_lead_limit_menu) displaying the maximum resistance beyond which a source lead is taken as open. The resistance is in Ohms between 10 and 999999:

To set the maximum allowed DUT resistance:

- Title: __100.000E+1 Î©__.
- Description: _Max DUT R_.

The range is: 10 - 999999.

Moving the cursor over the digits, the digit blinks. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` and turning the _Wheel_ changes the digit between 0 and 9. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` selects the new value.

<a name="Contact_Check_Algorithm"></a>
##### Contact Check Algorithm

The contact check function prevents measurements that may be in error due to excessive resistance in the force or sense leads when making remotely sensed (Kelvin) measurements. Potential sources for this resistance include a poor contact at the device under test (DUT), a failing relay contacts on a switching card or wires that are too long or thin. The contact check function also detects an open circuit that may occur when a four-point probe is misplaced or misaligned. This relationship is shown schematically in the figure below, where R~C~ is the resistance of the mechanical contact at the DUT, and R~S~ is the series resistance of cables and any series relays.

![](ContactCheckDiagram.png)

The leads contacts are checked if the maximum leads resistance (see below) is set to a non-zero positive value. Contacts are measured before taking the initial resistance measurement. The measurement is aborted and the lead resistances are displayed if the measured lead resistances exceeds the maximum limit. 

A custom contact check algorithm is implemented in the TTM firmware as a workaround for the instrument failure to detect an open lead if either the low or high source lead is open. 

The custom algorithm measured the DUT resistance measurement after conducting the standard contact check if this check did find open contacts. This measurement yields a high resistance if a source lead is open or if the DUT leads are open. Thus, this measurement can be used to detect an open source lead.

To this end, the custom algorithm work as follows:

1. An _openLeadsStatus_ value is set to _unknown_ when the measurements are initiated.
1. The custom contact check method is then called before each of the initial resistance, thermal transient and final resistance measurements.
1. The nominal contact check method is called to detect an open contact. 
1. The algorithm then reads the lead resistances, _lowLeadsR_ and _highLeadsR_ as reported by the nominal contact check algorithm.
1. If the contact check fails, the firmware sets the _openLeadsStatus_ to either _low_ if the low leads resistance exceeds the high leads resistance or to _high_ if the low leads resistance is
 lower than the high leads resistance.
1. If the nominal contact check did not fail then the custom algorithm kicks in.
1. If the _Limit_ set in the [Open Source Lead Limit Menu](#open_source_lead_limit_menu) is zero, the algorithm sets a _dutR_ value to zero.
1. If the _Limit_ set in the [Open Source Lead Limit Menu](#open_source_lead_limit_menu) is positive, _dutR_ is set to the measured resistances using a current source of 100ÂµA of 0.1 power line cycles with a voltage limit of one volt (most likely leading to taking the measurement under a compliance state, which is fine). The measured _dut_R_ is not corrected for the presence of shunt resistors, which means that the actual open DUT value is likely higher.
1. If _dutR_ exceeds the _Limit_, the _openLeadsStatus_ is set to _openDutLeads_.
1. If the algorithm found open leads, the measured resistance of the TTM entity, either _Initial Reisstance_, _Final Resistance_ or _Trace_initial, is the to the _NaN_ (9.91e+37).
1. If the algorithm found an open DUT, the measured resistance of the TTM entity, either _Initial Reisstance_, _Final Resistance_ or _Trace_initial, is the to the measured _dutR_.

<a name="Contact_Check_DUT_Voltage"></a>
##### Contact Check DUT Voltage

Testing for open contacts is done by forcing a small 300ÂµA current into the sense lead, amplifying the voltage drop via a high impedance amplifier and reading this voltage by the instrument voltmeter. A significant voltage might develop across the DUT leads if the DUT leads are open during the contact check.

For instance the following values where measured:

}DUT   | Source Low | Sense Low | Sense High | Source High | Max Volts | Min Volts |
|------|------------|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
|Open  | Wired      | Wired     | Wired      | Wired       | 0.3       | -0.64     |
|Open  | Wired      | Open      | Wired      | Wired       | 0.32      | -0.22     |
|Open  | Open       | Wired     | Wired      | Wired       | 2.81      | -5.39     |
|3.3KÎ© | Open       | Wired     | Wired      | Wired       | 1.07      | -1.15     |
|Open  | Wired      | Open      | Open       | Wired       | 0.12      | -0.16     |
|Open  | Open       | Wired     | Wired      | Open        | 1.29      | -2.73     |
|3.3KÎ© | Open       | Wired     | Wired      | Open        | 1.09      | -1.33     |
|~2Î©   | any        | any       | any        | any         | < 50mv    | < 50mv    |

Apparently, the contact check circuit current runs through the device under test causing a significant voltage drop if the DUT resistance is high or open. Shunt resistors of 3.3KÎ© were wired across both the source and sense terminal to limit the voltage across an open device under test.

<a name="Meter_Shunts_Menu"></a>
### Shunts Menu

Selecting _Shunts_ from the [Meter Menu](#meter_menu) displays the [Shunts Menu](#Meter_Shunts_Menu). This menu sets the values of the shunt resistances that are placed across the source and sense leads. The value is set to 0 if no shunt resistances are used. The front panel displays __Shunts__ with the following options: 

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Source | Selects the [Source Shunt Menu](#Source_Shunt_menu) |
| Sense  | Selects the [Sense Shunt Menu](#Sense_Shunt_menu) |

Moving the cursor over an option and pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` selects this option. Pressing `EXIT` returns to the [Meter Menu](#meter_menu).

The shunt resistances are used to limit the voltage drop across the DUT in case the contact check fails and the contact check current flows through the DUT. 

The shunt resistances thus entered are used to correct the measured resistance such that the measured resistance equals the corrected resistance in parallel with the effective shunt, which is the parallel of the two shunt resistances. The shunt resistances are ignored if set to zero. The resistance range is 0 to 9999 ohms.

<a name="Source_Sunt_Menu"></a>
##### Source Shunt Menu

Selecting _Source_ from the [Shunts Menu](#Meter_Shunts_Menu) displays the [Source Shunt Menu](#Source_Shunt_Menu). This menu sets the resistance of the shunt resistor that is connected across the source terminals of the instrument:

- Description: _Source shunt or 0 if none_

The range is: 0 - 9999 Î©.

Moving the cursor over the digits, the digit blinks and changes with the rotation of the _Navigation Wheel_ the number blinks. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` and turning the _Wheel_ changes the digit between 0 and 9. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` selects the new value.

<a name="Sense_Sunt_Menu"></a>
##### Sense Shunt Menu

Selecting _Sense_ from the [Shunts Menu](#Meter_Shunts_Menu) displays the [Sense Shunt Menu](#Sense_Shunt_Menu). This menu sets the resistance of the shunt resistor that is connected across the Sense terminals of the instrument:

- Title: __03300 Î©__.
- Description: _Sense shunt or 0 if none_

The range is: 0 - 9999 Î©.

Moving the cursor over the digits, the digit blinks and changes with the rotation of the _Navigation Wheel_ the number blinks. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` and turning the _Wheel_ changes the digit between 0 and 9. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` selects the new value.

<a name="Resistance_menu"></a>
### Resistance Menu

Selecting _Resistance_ from the [Main Menu](#Main_menu) displays the [Resistance Menu](#Resistance_menu), which is used to set the parameters for the initial and final cold resistance measurements. The front panel displays __Cold Resistance__ with the following options: 

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [Source](#Source_menu) | Selects the source modality as current or voltage |
| [Level](#Level_menu) | Selects source level |
| [Limit](#Limit_menu) | Sets the sense limit |
| [Aperture](#Aperture_menu) | Sets the duration that the source is applied to the device under test |
| [Limits](#Limits_menu) | Selects the [Limits](#Limits_menu). |
| [Status](#Status_menu) | Selects the [Status](#Status_menu) condition menu. |

<a name="Source_menu"></a>
#### Source Menu

Selecting _Source_ from the [Resistance Menu](#Resistance_menu) displays the [Source Menu](#Source_menu). The front panel displays __Source: Voltage__ or __Source: Current__ with the following options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Voltage | Selects the source modality as voltage |
| Current | Selects the source modality as current |

Either a Voltage or a Current source can be selected to force voltage or current, respectively for measuring the cold resistance.

Moving the cursor over an option and pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` selects this option. Pressing `EXIT` returns to the [Resistance Menu](#Resistance_menu).

<a name="Level_menu"></a>
#### Level Menu

Selecting _Level_ from the [Resistance Menu](#Resistance_menu) displays the [Level Menu](#Level_menu). This menu sets the level of the source modality. The selected level is forced by the TTM instrument onto (Voltage) or through (Current) the bridge-wire when measuring the bridge-wire resistance. This forcing level must be small so as not to trip or excessively heat the bridge-wire.

The display depends on the [Source Menu](#Source_menu) option. For _Voltage_ the display is:

- Title: __0010 mV__.
- Description: _Source Voltage_.

The range is: 1 - 999 mV.

For _Current_ the display is:

- Title: __0010 mA__.
- Description: _Source Current_.

The range is: 1 - 50 mA

Moving the cursor over the digits, the digit blinks and changes with the rotation of the _Navigation Wheel_ the number blinks. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` and turning the _Wheel_ changes the digit between 0 and 9. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` selects the new value.

<a name="Limit_menu"></a>
#### Limit Menu

Selecting _Limit_ from the [Resistance Menu](#Resistance_menu) displays the [Limit Menu](#Limit_menu). This menu sets the Limit of the sense modality. The display depends on the [Source Menu](#Source_menu) option.

<a name="voltage_source_current_limit"></a>
##### Voltage Source Current Limit

For _Voltage_ the display is:

- Title: __050 mA__.
- Description: _Current Limit_.

The range is: 1 - 50 mA

The [Voltage Source Current Limit](#voltage_source_current_limit) is the highest current that the instrument would allow to flow through the bridge-wire when forcing voltage across the bridge-wire. This limit will be reached if the bridge-wire exhibits a low resistance at which point the measurement is said to hit [Compliance](#Compliance).

<a name="current_source_voltage_limit"></a>
##### Current Source Voltage Limit

For _Current_ the display is:

- Title: __010 mV__.
- Description: _Voltage Limit_.

The range is: 1 - 999 mV.

The [Current Source Voltage Limit](#current_source_voltage_limit) is the highest voltage that the instrument would allow over the bridge-wire when forcing current through the bridge-wire. This limit will be reached if the bridge-wire is open or exhibits a very high resistance at which point the measurement is said to hit [Compliance](#Compliance).

<a name="Compliance"></a>
##### Compliance

The measurement is said to hit [Compliance](#Compliance) if the measurement forcing modality, e.g., voltage or current, caused the measured modality, e.g, current or voltage respectively, to reach the limit set by the [Limit Menu](#Limit_menu). At compliance, the forced modality reaches a level that is lower than the level set in the [Level Menu](#Level_menu) thus protecting the bridge-wire from over voltage or current.

<a name="Aperture_menu"></a>
#### Aperture Menu

Selecting _Aperture_ from the [Resistance Menu](#Resistance_menu) displays the [Aperture Menu](#Aperture_menu). This menu sets the Aperture, or duration, of the applied source level. The front panel displays:

- Title: __01.000 PLC__.
- Description: _Integration Period_.

The range is: 0.001 - 20.

This menu sets the duration of the measurement in power line cycles (PLC).

Moving the cursor over the digits, the digit blinks and changes with the rotation of the _Navigation Wheel_ the number blinks. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` and turning the _Wheel_ changes the digit between 0 and 9. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` selects the new value.

The aperture (integration period) defines the duration and, thereby the accuracy, of the cold resistance measurement. This value is defined in multiples or fractions of power line cycles (PLC). one (1) PLC equals to 1/60th of a second in the US. At 1 PLC the measurement accuracy exceeds 0.01%.

<a name="Limits_menu"></a>
#### Limits Menu

Selecting _Limits_ from the [Resistance Menu](#Resistance_menu) displays the [Limits Menu](#Limits_menu). The front panel displays __Limits__ with the following options: 

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Low | Selects the [Low Limit Menu](#Low-Limit_menu) |
| High | Selects the [High Limit Menu](#High-Limit_menu) |

Moving the cursor over an option and pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` selects this option. Pressing `EXIT` returns to the [Resistance Menu](#Resistance_menu).

Limits are used to determine if the measured value is within range (pass) or out of range (fail). 

The initial and final cold resistances are checked against the limits and the measurement outcome is set to __High__ or __Low__ if the values are out of range. 

If the initial resistance measurement fails, the measured value is displayed along with the outcome status (see [Status](#Status) below).

<a name="Low-Limit_menu"></a>
##### Low Limit Menu

Selecting _Low_ from the [Limits Menu](#Limits_menu) displays the [Low Limit Menu](#Low-Limit_menu). This menu sets the low limit of the measurement in Ohms. The front panel displays:

- Title: __01.920 Î©__.
- Description: _Low Limit_.

The range is: 0.1 - 10 Î©.

Moving the cursor over the digits, the digit blinks and changes with the rotation of the _Navigation Wheel_ the number blinks. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` and turning the _Wheel_ changes the digit between 0 and 9. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` selects the new value.

<a name="High-Limit_menu"></a>
##### High Limit Menu

Selecting _High_ from the [Limits Menu](#Limits_menu) displays the [High Limit Menu](#High-Limit_menu). This menu sets the High limit of the measurement in Ohms. The front panel displays:

- Title: __02.160 Î©__.
- Description: _High Limit_.

The range is: 0.1 - 10 Î©.

Moving the cursor over the digits, the digit blinks and changes with the rotation of the _Navigation Wheel_ the number blinks. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` and turning the _Wheel_ changes the digit between 0 and 9. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` selects the new value.

<a name="Status_menu"></a>
#### Status Menu

Selecting _Status_ from the [Resistance Menu](#Resistance_menu) displays the [Status Menu](#Status_menu):

- Title: __002__.
- Description: _66=compliance 64 or over-temp 2_.

The expected range are: 2, 64, 66.

This sets bit values that toggle the over-temperature failure condition (2) or compliance failure condition (64). For example, setting the value to 2 the instrument will fail under an over-temperature condition but will not fail if the sense current or voltage reaches the limit set with the [Limit Menu](#Limit_menu).

Moving the cursor over the digits, the digit blinks and changes with the rotation of the _Navigation Wheel_ the number blinks. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` and turning the _Wheel_ changes the digit between 0 and 9. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` selects the new value.

<a name="Buffer-Status"></a>
##### Buffer Status

In addition to measuring the cold resistance, the instrument reports a _Buffer Status_ byte where each bit represents a specific setting or outcome as follows:

|Bit|Name|Hex Value|Decimal Value|Description|
|----|----|----|----|
|B0|Reserved|0x01|1|Reserved for future use|
|B1|Over-temp|0x02|2|Over temperature condition|
|B2|AutoRangeMeas|0x04|4|Measure range was auto ranged|
|B3|AutoRangeSrc|0x08|8|Source range was auto ranged|
|B4|4Wire|0x10|16|4-wire (remote) sense mode was enabled|
|B5|Rel|0x20|32|Relative offset was applied to a reading|
|B6|Compliance|0x40|64|Source function was in compliance|
|B7|Filtered|0x80|128|Reading was filtered|

- Select _Status_ from the _Cold Resistance_ menu;
- The _Fail Status Compliance 64 Over-temp 2_ prompt will display showing the status bitmask that is to indicate a failed cold resistance measurement;
- Press the thumb wheel to select and then increase or decrease the value;
- Press `ENTER` to accept or `EXIT` to cancel the changes.

The [Status Menu](#Status_menu) settings of the Thermal Transient Meter allows the operator to select what status values are interpreted as a failed measurement.

The legacy revisions of the TTM firmware prior to and including 2.3.4009 has taken either or both the over-temp and compliance status bits to indicate a failure. With the new firmware, the operator can choose to accept a measurement that hits a [Compliance](#Compliance) condition. For example, the operator may choose to apply a voltage of 100 mV but limit the current at 20 mA. When making this measurement on a 2 Ohm bridge-wire, the instrument will _hit compliance_. The measurement accuracy will still be acceptable. In the case, the operator will set the Status settings to 2 instead of the default of 66.

The measurement outcome and status are displayed along with the bridge-wire resistance and low or high indication if the initial cold resistance measurement failed. Typically a status value of 28 will display indicating that a 4-wire measurement was taken under auto range conditions.

##### Legacy support
In order to support the legacy Visual Basic software the status settings defaults to over-temp only. This way, the instrument can be set to source voltage using the [Source_menu](#Source_menu) while still using the legacy current source settings which would cause the instrument to hit [Compliance](#Compliance).

Use [Thermal Transient Menu](#Thermal-Transient_menu) items to set the test parameters of the thermal transient forcing and measurement parameters.

<a name="Source_Current_menu"></a>
#### Source Current Menu

Selecting _Current_ from the [Thermal Transient Menu](#Thermal-Transient_menu) displays the [Source Current Menu](#Source_Current_menu). This menu sets the current level of the thermal transient pulse:

- Title: __297 mA__.
- Description: _Source Current_.

The range is: 10 - 999 mA.

Moving the cursor over the digits, the digit blinks and changes with the rotation of the _Navigation Wheel_ the number blinks. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` and turning the _Wheel_ changes the digit between 0 and 9. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` selects the new value.

The source current is the current that is forced by the TTM instrument through the bridge-wire to measure the bridge-wire thermal transient response. This current is pulsed through the bridge-wire for a very short duration determined by the [Period Menu](#Transient_Period_menu) value times the [Thermal Transient Points Menu](#Transient_Points_menu) value.

<a name="Maximum_Voltage_menu"></a>
#### Maximum Voltage Menu

Selecting _Voltage_ from the [Thermal Transient Menu](#Thermal-Transient_menu) displays the [Maximum Voltage Menu](#Maximum_Voltage_menu). This menu sets the Voltage limit of the sense modality:

- Title: __0.990 V__.
- Description: _Voltage Limit_.

The range is: 10 - 999 mV.

Moving the cursor over the digits, the digit blinks and changes with the rotation of the _Navigation Wheel_ the number blinks. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` and turning the _Wheel_ changes the digit between 0 and 9. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` selects the new value.

The maximum voltage is the limit set by the instrument for the maximum voltage that could develop on the bridge-wire during the thermal transient test. This limit will be reached if the bridge-wire is open or exhibits a very high resistance.

<a name="Transient_Aperture_menu"></a>
#### Thermal Transient Aperture Menu

Selecting _Aperture_ from the [Thermal Transient Menu](#Thermal-Transient_menu) displays the [Thermal Transient Aperture Menu](#Transient_Aperture_menu). This menu sets the Aperture, or duration, of each measurement of the current pulse point:

- Description: _Integration Period_.

The range is: 0.001 - 0.01.

This menu sets the duration of the measurement in power line cycles (PLC).

Moving the cursor over the digits, the digit blinks and changes with the rotation of the _Navigation Wheel_ the number blinks. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` and turning the _Wheel_ changes the digit between 0 and 9. Pressing the _Wheel_ or `ENTER` selects the new value.

The aperture (integration period) defines the duration and accuracy of the thermal transient measurement. This value is defined in multiples or fractions of power line cycles (PLC). One (1) PLC equals to 1/60th of a second in the US. Thermal transients are measured during a very short pulse period. Therefore, a very small integration period is allowed for the thermal transient.

<a name="Transient_Points_menu"></a>
#### Thermal Transient Points Menu

Selecting _Points_ from the [Thermal Transient Menu](#Thermal-Transient_menu) displays the [Thermal Transient Points Menu](#Transient_Points_menu). This menu sets the number of points of the current pulse applied during the thermal transient measurement:

<a name="Measuring_Using_the_Front_Panel"></a>
## Measuring Using the Front Panel

The instrument takes a new measurement when triggered.

Triggering form the front panel of the instrument is done as follows:

- [Start](#Starting) the instrument.
- Wait for the [Action Panel](#Action-Panel).
- Press the `TRIG` button to obtain new measurements.
- [Read](#Reading_the_Outcome) the outcome from the digital I/O.

A failed measurement is designated on the instrument panel by a blinking prefix character. For example, if Final Resistance failed, the R preceding the measured value will blink with changing intensity. Upon a failure of the initial resistance measurement the instrument displays the resistance, the high or low indication, the outcome value and status (see [status] above}.

To exit from the [Action Panel](#Action-Panel) mode, press the `RUN` key.

<a name="Measuring_Using_the_TRG_Command"></a>
## Measuring Using the `*TRG` command

The instrument takes a new measurement when triggered.

The instrument `*TRG` command can be used to trigger a measurement as follows:

- Start the instrument;
- Connect the instrument using an external interface such as GPIB or Ethernet;
- Send the `*TRG` command.
- [Read](#Reading_the_Outcome) the outcome from the digital I/O.

A failed measurement is designated on the instrument panel by a blinking prefix character. For example, if Initial Resistance failed, the R preceding the measured value will blink with changing intensity.

<a name="Measuring_Using_Digital_Input"></a>
## Measuring Using a Digital Input

![](TriggerDiagram.png)

<a name="Triggering"></a>
## Triggering

The instrument provides full hand shake for controlling the measurement by way of the [Digital I/O](#F186A3EE9ED4B6DB25D2650896E4DA3333AE075B) port:

- Trigger a measurement by taking line 1 of the digital I/O port from low to high.
- The instrument responds by taking line 2 high. Line 3 goes low as well as the pass/fail lines 4 through 7.
- Line 3 goes high when the measurement completes at which time the measurement outcomes are available on lines 4 through 7.

<a name="Reading_the_Outcome"></a>
## Reading the Outcome

Measurement outcomes are signaled by lines 4 through 6 of the digital I/O. Values are valid once line 3 goes high:

- Line 4: Initial resistance pass (high) or fail (low);
- Line 5: Final resistance pass (high) or fail (low);
- Line 6: Thermal Transient in range (high) or out of range (low);
- Line 7: All above tests passed (high) or one of them failed (low);

<a name="Outcome_Values"></a>
### Outcome values

Upon a failure of the initial resistance measurement the instrument display the resistance, the high or low indication, the outcome value and status (see [status] above"></a>. The outcome bit values are:

|Bit|Name|Hex Value|Decimal Value|Description|
|----|----|----|----|
|B0|badStatus|0x01|1|Sampling returned bad status from the buffer| 
|B1|badTimeStamps|0x02|2|Sampling returned bad time stamps|
|B2|configFailed|0x04|4|Configuration failed|
|B3|initiationFailed|0x08|8|Pulse initiation failed|
|B4|loadFailed|0x10|16|Scripts not loaded completely|
|B5|notMeasured|0x20|32|Measurement not completed|
|B6|measurementFailed|0x40|64|Measurement failed (e.g., infinite reading due to open sense lines)|
|B7|openLeads|0x80|128|open leads|

#### Clear
Upon clear, which is issued before each measurement, the outcome is set to 0 (Okay) 

#### Legacy Support
The internal outcome value of the instrument is set to the `Lua` `nil` value upon clear. 
The outcome status bit is set if the contact check failed. 

<a name="Measurement_Readings"></a>
### Measurement Readings

Measurement readings are retrieved from the instrument after the measurements are completed.

The API driver sets triggered measurements by starting a infinite loop in the instrument.  The driver may lock the front panel. In addition, by default, the driver sets the firmware to output `OPC` upon the completion of each triggered measurement cycle. This is done by sending a command such this:

```
prepareForTrigger(true,'OPC') waitcomplete()
```

Once the `OPC` message is placed on the output buffer, the instrument turns on the message available (MAV) bit of the status register. Thus, the driver can detect the completion of measurements by monitoring the message available bit of the instrument status register:

```
<read status byte> and MAV equals MAV
```

Once detected, the driver reads the `OPC` message and then fetches the initial, final and thermal transient readings. Typically, the driver also reads the measurement outcome of each of the initial, final and thermal transient measurements as an additional indication of the measurement status.

#### Special Values

The following Special readings might be output (SCPI-Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments):

`SCPI Positive Infinity 9.9E+37` if the measured resistance current is zero and the voltage is positive.
`SCPI Negative Infinity -9.91E+37` if the measured resistance current is zero and the voltage is negative.
`SCPI Not A Number (NaN) 9.91E+37` if the the resistance contact check failed.
`SCPI Not A Number (NaN) 9.91E+34` if the the thermal transient contact check failed, which the driver multiplies by 1000.
